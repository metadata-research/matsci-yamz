To make changes to the Matsci YAMZ repository, follow these steps to ensure they get deployed safely and properly.

1. Create a new feature branch locally by running `git checkout -b feature/[your-feature-name-here]` from the main branch. 
2. Once you're done with your changes, add them to a commit and push the changes (make sure you are pushing to the feature branch you created, not the main branch). Keep in mind that since created your branch locally, you will have to create the branch on the remote by running `git push --set-upstream origin [your-feature-branch]`. Here's what will happen if you dont add the set upstream option:

```
addyire in ~/projects/matsci-yamz on feature/ci-cd λ git push
fatal: The current branch feature/ci-cd has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin feature/ci-cd

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
```

3. After successfully pushing your changes, the next step is to create a pull request (PR) on GitHub. This can easily be done by clicking the link when pushing your new branch to remote for the first time, or by going to GitHub (MSYAMZ Repo -> Pull Request -> Create). Ensure that you are merging your feature branch into main. 

```
addyire in ~/projects/matsci-yamz on feature/ci-cd λ  git push --set-upstream origin feature/ci-cd

remote: Create a pull request for 'feature/ci-cd' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/metadata-research/matsci-yamz/pull/new/feature/ci-cd <== CLICK THIS
remote:
To github.com:metadata-research/matsci-yamz.git
 * [new branch]      feature/ci-cd -> feature/ci-cd
branch 'feature/ci-cd' set up to track 'origin/feature/ci-cd'.
```

4. Once the PR is created, GitHub will run a workflow to ensure the code lints, builds, and ensures the DB migrations are consistent. This action MUST run successfully before the feature branch can be merged into main. If it fails, check the logs of the action to see why, make the necessary changes, and then push any updates to the feature branch (you don't need to make a new PR).

5. Once the PR checks have passed successfully, you should then be able to click "Merge Pull Request". Merging the PR will first merge the changes into the main branch and then kick off the deploy script on the id.cci server.
